              <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 5px;">“Self hatred, to the young warrior who travels upon his path, is like an itch in the back of your mind that you cannot scratch. You can’t even define it, much like the electron, unexplainable, but yet observable. You can look into it all you want, try to write it down on paper, retracing the steps of a maddening bug that exists within your system. However, once you begin to see it in the relationships with all things inside your own grey matter, will the truth reveal itself. Now I cannot sit here and preach that I know the truth, well because the truth only lies when everything is one. That is why the yogi’s ramble on about balance. The seemingly observant truth for me however, was that I don’t even believe in balance. Yet I still let this long and tangled hair grow on my head,deciding to live up here in the mountains, playing my humble guitar for the wind and leaves that so carry it on for miles. I prefer to feel what there is to feel, while most of my music dances across from major to minor. And only when you disregard the meaning of just one line, instead looking at its relationship and flow to the other lines, will its inherent meaning rise. And that meaning is only for you to discover, not me as the writer, but you as the listener.  You are the only way to bring meaning to the words that even I am speaking right now. I don’t think I have any purpose in life, so when I get sad I don’t look on for tomorrow. I enjoy all the feeling that there is to feel, because the world of tomorrow holds no answers, except the probability of never being able to experience what I see before my eyes ever again. So this one second, that exists right now, is enough reason for me to live. The time between my breaths and my exhales, there lies the shining light that we call grace.”
              </br>
            </br>
                “Oh undoubtedly I get distracted, I was talking about self hatred. A given in this maddening present we live in. The very meaning of your entire life is summarized when the advertisements try to sell it back to you. So self hatred, in nature, out here where I live, means nothing. The concept is only known in the back corners of your dusty mind, in society’s cluster, waiting to be cleaned when you gather enough strength to sweep the broom, and dust the spider webs. But don’t worry, there is no rush, like I said, I prefer to feel all there is to feel. Eventually you will find a way to brighten up that soggy room of yours, and who knows, you might find a gleaming painting of your long lost love. Do not search for it, but instead let it come to you, because if you enter that room too early, you might not be ready to appreciate its beauty. ”
